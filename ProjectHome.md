# Overview #
The RFID rally logger project is a competition event logger.

This project was initially created for motorbike time rallies where each competitor gets an RFID tag that has been registered to them.

At each station the rider/competitor swipes the tag.  The station number, Card ID and a time stamp is recorded to a CSV file onto an SD memory card.

At the end of the event all stations cards are collected and uploaded onto a central station for results and timekeeping purposes.

This system would work for any event where time keeping accurate to the second over a number of way-points is required for competitors.
